                    <h3>An "Infodemic"</h3>
                    <p>The World Health Organization coined the term "Infodemic" to represent the spread of inaccurate or incorrect information during a pandemic outbreak [1]. With the spread of misinformation over the past year, there is growing concern that people will distrust the advice of legitimate sources and engage in activity that could be detrimental to general health and public well-being.</p>
                    <p>With the overwhelming spread of inaccurate information regarding the pandemic on public platforms (such as social media), there is an increasing need to be able to identify prevalent false statements so that they can be countered with facts. By analyzing Twitter data since March 2020, we are able to identify the rise and fall of negative sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and the most prevalent anti-vaccination beliefs that are likely to contribute to these stances. By isolating these beliefs, public officials can focus efforts on countering the specific pieces of misinformation that are likely to have the most harmful effect on public health.</p>

                    <h3>Negative Sentiment towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Persists</h3>
                    <p>As reported by the New York Times in December 2020, more than 25% of Americans "probably or definitely would not take a coronavirus vaccine" [2]. A June 2020 survey by Nature Medicine shows significant fluctuations in citizens' willingness to take the vaccine when broken down by country. 88.62% of Chinese citizens said they would take the vaccine, while only 54.85% of Russian citizens would be willing to do so [3].</p>
                    <div class="tweet-sentiment">
                        <p>Data collected from the social media platform Twitter reflects this continued hesitancy to trust a COVID-19 vaccination. Sentiment analysis of tweets with the "COVIDVaccine" hashtag since March 2020 show continuous negative feelings towards the immunization.</p>
