                    <h3>An "Infodemic"</h3>
                    <p>The spread of misinformation during the pandemic is known to cause society to engage in risky behaviour. It's pervasive enough that World Health Organisation has dubbed it "infodemic" - the spread of inaccurate or incorrect information during an outbreak [1]. Doomscrolling, New Zealand's word of the year, fuelled the infodemic around the world. As people around the globe searched media platforms of all kinds desperately for information about the pandemic, the spread of false news encouraged some to engage in acts that are detrimental to their well-being, including false information regarding health guidelines about the coronavirus. Over 200 different vaccines are being developed, just about a quarter are in human trials [2], and several are being rolled out to citizens, and while we all hope the vaccine is our saving grace, distortions in media are having an impact on peoples' willingness to get vaccinated.</p>
