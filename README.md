Welcome to our GitHub repository analyzing misinformation related coronavirus
vaccination hesitancy. This repository along with its [website](https://sodp-team114.herokuapp.com/) represents
Team 114's submission in the 2021 [Stanford Open Datathon](https://datathon.stanford.edu/).

To combat the overwhelming spread of inaccurate information regarding the pandemic on public platforms (such as social media), our goal is to identify the most prevalent false statements about the vaccine so that they can be purposefully countered with data-driven factual information.

Here we identify the continued trend of negative sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine using Twitter data. The most prevalent anti-vaccination beliefs are likely to emerge from analyzing tweet content, hashtags, and user engagement since the official declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Isolating these beliefs allows public officials to focus efforts on combating the specific pieces of misinformation that may have the most harmful effect on public health.
